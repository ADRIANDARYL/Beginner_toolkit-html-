## 6. AI Prompt Journal 
• Prompt Used	What AI Said	What I Learned

• "What is the most basic HTML page structure?"	AI gave the !DOCTYPE html, html, head, body structure.(Every HTML page needs this skeleton).

• "How do I add an image in HTML?"	AI showed img src="url" alt="description",	Images need src for source and alt for accessibility.

• "How to make a list in HTML?"	AI gave ul for bullet points ,li for each item. There are ordered lists too.	Lists help organize information.


## 7. Common Issues & Fixes
•	Page doesn't show anything: 
Did you save as .html?
The file must have the .html extension for it to run.
•	Image not showing:
 Check if URL is correct
Also check if the image path exists.
•	Link doesn't work: 
Make sure href has https://
